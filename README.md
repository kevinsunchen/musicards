## What is musicards?

musicards! (https://musicards-mit.herokuapp.com/) is a fun way to find new music and share your favorite songs with others! Log in with Spotify, make requests, trade songs, and build your deck :)

musicards! was originally made for the 2021 MIT Web.lab Competition (https://weblab.mit.edu/). It received 3rd place overall, the Most Unique Concept Award, and the Appian Sponsor Award.
